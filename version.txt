Build 52
	* Fixed problem with trying to extract the region name from the endpoint property
	* Updated logging for region name matching so that it doesn't trigger the wrong error message 

Build 51
	* Fixed null region name when `useDefaultRegion` was set
	* Add stack trace logging to the IllegalStateException that we log when the AWS SDK version is too old

Build 50
	* Added support for all AWS S3 authentication methods. If credentials aren't set in properties then the `Default Credentials Provider Chain` will be used. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default for details.
	* Added `s3UploadAwsProfile` property to define a aws profile to use. default: null
	* Added `s3UploadAwsProfilePath` property to define a different location for the aws profile settings default: null
	* Added `s3UploadRegion` property to define the region that the s3 bucket is located in. default: null
	* Added `s3UploadUseDefaultRegion` property to tell the uploader to use the same region as the EC2 instance or the default region set by the AWS SDK if `s3UploadRegion` isn't set. default: true
	* Added `s3UploadAllowBucketRegionOverride` property to turn on global bucket access so that a region mismatch won't cause uploads to fail. default: true
	* Added support for S3 Canned ACLs. `s3UploadCannedAcl` property is used to specify the the canned ACL from the list here, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl. default: null
	* Modified workflow so that s3 failures wouldn't prevent recordings from being marked for upload, allowing them to upload automatically once service is resumed.

Build 49
	* Changed storageDir field to reference `streamRecorderOutputPath` property, if set

Build 48
	* Fixed problem with deleting local files if a file prefix was set

Build 47
	* Added `s3UploadDelay` property to delay the start of an upload to allow for cases where a stream is re-published. Default value is 0
	* Added `s3UploadFilePrefix` property to specify a path to upload the files to. Default not set
	* Added `s3UploadVersionFile` property to control file versioning. When enabled, we will check to see if the file exists in the s3 bucket and add an incrementing version number to the new uploaded file as required. Default is false (don't version)
	* Added `s3UploadDebugLog` property to enable extra debug logging

Build 46
	* Added method to restart failed uploads after a timeout without having to wait for an appInstance restart
		* Added Boolean property `s3UploadRestartFailedUploads`. Default true
		* Added Integer Property `s3UploadRestartFailedUploadTimeout`. Default 60000
	* Streamlined upload initialisation so all uploads use a single method
	* Fixed bug in file search so that subfolders are indexed correctly

Build 45
	* Fixed problem with extracting mediaName where leading separator chars were not being removed on Windows platforms

Build 44
	* Fixed module initialisation error caused by missing property values
	* Changed method used to shutdown the transfer manager so that the S3Client isn't closed immediately which was throwing a socket exception if there are active transfers
	* Added code to touch the appInstance while an upload is in progress so it doesn't automatically time out until the uploads are complete

Build 43
	* Fixed bug that was introduced in previous commit which prevented uploads from resuming after an application restart

Build 42
	* S3 ACL File permissions (#3)

Build 37
	* Added a property (s3UploadEndpoint) for setting the S3 endpoint that the bucket is in. Required for locations that only support V4 authentication and optional for other locations. Not required for the default location
	* Changed bucket detection so we can make sure the user has permission to write to it
	* Added better logging in onAppStart to detect problems with connecting to S3
	* Updated README.md required packages list
